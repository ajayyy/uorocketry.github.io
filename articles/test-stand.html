                Static test stands are crucial in the process of designing and creating a successful hybrid motor. It provides a physical setup of acquiring data on temperature, pressure, and thrust of the motor during a test. This article covers the setup of our team’s first test stand, the downsides of it, as well as a brief plan for a future test stand.
							</p>
							<p>
                The first design of our static test stand resembled that of a coffee table. Large planks of wood were nailed together to provide an elevated and flat surface for the rocket motor to be mounted on. The wood was protected with a layer of sheet metal where two lubricated rails were placed. At the end of the rails, a steel L-shaped stopper was placed in order to stop the rocket from dismounting itself from the stand. The stopper was also designed to hold a load cell to obtain thrust values. An additional wooden structure was built to hold the large nitrous tank close to the stand. Although our test stand is fairly easy to fabricate and assemble, there are a few downsides to it.
							</p>
							<p>
                The test stand, as the name suggests, must be static. Therefore a strong and robust build is crucial in order to withstand the thrust from the rocket motor. The four legs of our wooden structure as well as the high center of mass of the stand does not provide enough stability or strength to withstand very high thrust from a motor. It’s very difficult to bolt down this structure to any surface to ensure that it wont move. Therefore, in order to provide a strong and robust build, the stand can be made out of galvanized steel. Despite its disadvantage that it is hard to drill or cut through, it would provide the strength and weight we need to withstand high thrust. This structure can have an L-shaped framework with an implementation of several triangles to ensure stability. The use of UniStruts could also be used in order to facilitate the process of bolting down the stand to a surface of greater mass. The idea I’m basing myself off of is that made from Aercon Systems seen in <i>figure 1</i>.

                Additionally, no pumping is required with this type of engine.
                One of the main complications with liquid engines is that the
                propellant streams must be carefully pumped in the combustion
                chamber, or else there would be incomplete combustion or the
                rocket could explode. These additional components, while giving
                an edge to liquid engines in terms of performance and supreme
                controllability, also add potential points of failure.
							</p>
							<p>
                To fully understand the inherent safety of a hybrid rocket engine,
                the following scenario could be considered. It is always a possibility
                that something goes wrong during the ignition sequence. The solid
                motor would not be able to abort the sequence. Rather it would shoot
                off, only to be controlled by the laws of nature. In the case of a
                liquid rocket engine, both the fuel and oxidizer would be present
                (before the flow was stopped) and leave the combustion chamber without
                combusting. This creates an area which is highly susceptible to explosions.
                With the hybrid engine, the flow of oxidizer could be cut off much like
                the liquid engine. And unlike the liquid engine, while some oxidizer
                would escape the chamber, not much fuel would be present for combustion
                making it slightly safer in this case. Of course this is not to
                say solid motors and liquid engines should not be developed.
                Comparisons such as these give an insight as to why the hybrid
                rocket engine is inherently safer than its counter parts.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is interesting to note that nitrous oxide provides another
                layer of safety because it requires a certain amount of activation
                energy in order for the oxygen atoms to disassociate before it
                can be considered a potent oxidizer. Therefore, an intentional
                ignition source is required to start combustion. While it is possible
                that accidents occur with nitrous oxide, it is not likely if even the
                most basic of safety standards are upheld.
							</p>
							<p>
								 	To conclude, although there is always a risk while dealing with
                  rockets, hybrid engines are inherently safer than their competitors
                  and ideal for the types of launches done by the uOttawa Student
                  Team of Aeronautics and Rocketry.
