                Working with rockets might be extremely gratifying and fun, but
                it’s also a dangerous task.  Many things could go wrong, one of
                which being the rocket blowing up. This was an important factor
                to consider while deciding on a type of rocket to design, which
                is why a hybrid engine was chosen. Indeed, this type of rocket
                eliminates many risks which are due to the lack of control in
                solid motors and the added complexity of liquid engines.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are many solutions to ensure acurate stoping of the rocket.
								The most promissing by far is an air braking mechanism which is
								triggered by an altimeter. With two simple onboard sensors
								measuring airspeed and altitude a PID controller would have all the
								information it needs to fire the air brake at an appropriate time.
							</p>
							<p>
								The hybrid engine meshes the concept of solid motors and liquid
                engines. The solid fuel used for our rocket is paraffin, which
                is essentially candle wax. This material is inert, which makes
                it easy to handle. Our oxidizer is liquid nitrous oxide, which
                is safer than other oxidizers since it is non-toxic and stable
                at room temperature. It is also self-regulated, which means no
                secondary gas is needed to pressurize the oxidizer tank while
                it’s being used: reducing complexity of the system as well.
							</p>
							<p>
                Additionally, no pumping is required with this type of engine.
                One of the main complications with liquid engines is that the
                propellant streams must be carefully pumped in the combustion
                chamber, or else there would be incomplete combustion or the
                rocket could explode. These additional components, while giving
                an edge to liquid engines in terms of performance and supreme
                controllability, also add potential points of failure.
							</p>
							<p>
                To fully understand the inherent safety of a hybrid rocket engine,
                the following scenario could be considered. It is always a possibility
                that something goes wrong during the ignition sequence. The solid
                motor would not be able to abort the sequence. Rather it would shoot
                off, only to be controlled by the laws of nature. In the case of a
                liquid rocket engine, both the fuel and oxidizer would be present
                (before the flow was stopped) and leave the combustion chamber without
                combusting. This creates an area which is highly susceptible to explosions.
                With the hybrid engine, the flow of oxidizer could be cut off much like
                the liquid engine. And unlike the liquid engine, while some oxidizer
                would escape the chamber, not much fuel would be present for combustion
                making it slightly safer in this case. Of course this is not to
                say solid motors and liquid engines should not be developed.
                Comparisons such as these give an insight as to why the hybrid
                rocket engine is inherently safer than its counter parts.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is interesting to note that nitrous oxide provides another
                layer of safety because it requires a certain amount of activation
                energy in order for the oxygen atoms to disassociate before it
                can be considered a potent oxidizer. Therefore, an intentional
                ignition source is required to start combustion. While it is possible
                that accidents occur with nitrous oxide, it is not likely if even the
                most basic of safety standards are upheld.
							</p>
							<p>
								 	To conclude, although there is always a risk while dealing with
                  rockets, hybrid engines are inherently safer than their competitors
                  and ideal for the types of launches done by the uOttawa Student
                  Team of Aeronautics and Rocketry.
